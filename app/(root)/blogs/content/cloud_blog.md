## Cost Optimization Best Practices

### Universal Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Right-size your resources**
   ```bash
   # Monitor and adjust instance sizes based on actual usage
   # Use built-in monitoring tools from each provider
   ```

2. **Implement auto-scaling**
   ```yaml
   # Scale resources based on demand
   # Set up alerts for cost thresholds
   ```

3. **Use spot instances for non-critical workloads**
   ```bash
   # Can save 70-90% on compute costs
   # Perfect for batch processing and development
   ```

4. **Optimize storage tiers**
   ```bash
   # Move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage
   # Implement lifecycle policies
   ```
