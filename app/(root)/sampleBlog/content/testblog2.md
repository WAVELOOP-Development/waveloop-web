# **Cross‑Platform Showdown: Flutter vs. React Native vs. Kotlin Multiplatform**

## Introduction

Cross-platform app development has become essential for companies looking to launch on both Android and iOS quickly and efficiently. However, the decision between **Flutter**, **React Native**, and **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** is not always straightforward.

Each framework offers unique strengths and weaknesses in terms of UI rendering, performance, learning curve, and ecosystem support. In this blog post, we dive deep into their differences to help you make an informed decision.

---

## Background & Architecture

| Framework | Language | Architecture | UI Approach |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Flutter** | Dart | Custom rendering engine | Fully custom UI |
| **React Native** | JavaScript | JS bridge to native components | Native UI |
| **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** | Kotlin | Shared business logic + native UI | Platform-native UI (Jetpack Compose/SwiftUI) |

- **Flutter** uses its own rendering engine (Impeller) for full control over visuals across platforms.
- **React Native** leverages a JavaScript bridge to communicate with native components.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform** shares business logic and still allows native UI development, offering great performance and native experience.

## Hello World Comparison

**Flutter** (Dart):
```dart
void main() => runApp(Text('Hello, World'));
```

**React Native** (JavaScript):
```jsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
const App = () => <Text>Hello, World</Text>;
```

**Kotlin Multiplatform**:
```kotlin
// Shared logic in KMP
fun getGreeting() = "Hello, World"
// UI part written separately using Jetpack Compose or SwiftUI
```

> KMP separates shared logic and UI. UI must be written natively for each platform, which can result in better performance but increased effort.

## Performance & Benchmarks

Here's how each stacks up in real-world app performance (start time, FPS, memory usage):

| Framework | Performance | Start Time | GPU Usage | Memory Footprint |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **KMP** | Native performance | Fast | Optimized | Low |
| **Flutter** | Very good | Slightly slower than native | Excellent | Medium |
| **React Native** | Slower in complex apps | Delayed due to JS bridge | High in graphic use | Higher |

- **Flutter** is best for UI-heavy apps, thanks to its efficient rendering engine.
- **KMP** excels in performance due to native UI and compiled code.
- **React Native** can suffer performance issues in animation-heavy or large-scale apps.

---

## Developer Experience & Ecosystem

| Framework | Learning Curve | Tooling | Ecosystem |
|-----------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Flutter** | Medium (Dart) | Excellent (hot reload, dev tools) | Mature |
| **React Native** | Easy (JS/TS) | Good | Huge JS ecosystem |
| **KMP** | Medium (Kotlin) | Improving | Smaller but growing |

- **Flutter** offers a unified development experience with a rich set of widgets and strong IDE support.
- **React Native** benefits from JavaScript's widespread use and ecosystem.
- **KMP** is ideal for Kotlin/Android developers, especially when performance is critical and logic reuse is the main goal.

## Choosing the Right One

| Use Case | Best Framework |
|----------|----------------|
| Need custom UI + fast dev | **Flutter** |
| Have JS expertise or web team | **React Native** |
| Require native UI + performance + shared logic | **Kotlin Multiplatform** |

**Choose Flutter** if:
- You want a consistent UI across platforms.
- You care about performance and visual polish.

**Choose React Native** if:
- Your team is strong in JavaScript or TypeScript.
- You want fast prototyping and lots of open-source libraries.

**Choose Kotlin Multiplatform** if:
- You want native performance and platform-specific UI.
- You're building complex Android-first apps and want to share logic with iOS.

---

## Conclusion

There's no one-size-fits-all solution. Each framework has its strengths:

- **Flutter** is a great choice for beautiful UIs and a unified codebase.
- **React Native** works best for teams already comfortable with web development.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform** excels in performance-critical apps where native UI is essential.

Choosing the right framework depends on your **team's skills**, **project complexity**, and **long-term goals**.

## Call to Action

Still unsure? Try creating a small prototype in each framework and compare:

- Development speed  
- UI flexibility  
- Performance  
- Code sharing and reusability
