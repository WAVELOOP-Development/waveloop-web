  //   title: "The Future of Web Development in 2024",
  //   excerpt:
  //     "Exploring the latest trends and technologies shaping the web development landscape, from AI integration to serverless architecture.",
  //   content: `
  //   The web development landscape is evolving rapidly, with new technologies and methodologies emerging every year. In 2024, we're seeing unprecedented changes in how we build, deploy, and maintain web applications. From the rise of edge computing to the integration of artificial intelligence in development workflows, the future looks both exciting and challenging. This comprehensive guide explores the key trends that will define web development in the coming years.
    
  //   ## AI-Powered Development
  //   One of the most significant shifts in 2024 is the widespread adoption of AI-powered tools in development workflows. Developers now rely on AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, CodeWhisperer, and other LLM-based tools to write boilerplate code, suggest improvements, and even perform automated testing. These tools increase productivity while reducing the time needed to ship features.
    
  //   ## Edge Computing and Serverless Architectures
  //   Traditional server models are giving way to edge computing and serverless functions. Platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Workers allow developers to deploy code closer to the user, resulting in faster response times and improved performance. This shift also promotes microservice-based designs that scale automatically without complex infrastructure management.

  //   ## The Rise of TypeScript and Modern Frameworks
  //   JavaScript continues to dominate, but TypeScript is now the default for many projects due to its improved type safety and developer experience. Frameworks like Next.js 14 and Remix are pushing boundaries with improved routing, file-based APIs, and enhanced performance optimizations out-of-the-box.

  //   ![AI Development Tools](/kota.jpg)

  //   ## Jamstack and Composable Architecture
  //   Content-heavy sites are now embracing the Jamstack architecture — decoupling frontend from backend using APIs and static site generators. Combined with headless CMS platforms like Sanity, Strapi, and Contentful, this approach improves scalability and enables better DX for content teams.

  //   ## Focus on Developer Experience (DX)
  //   Tools like TurboRepo, Vite, and Nx are streamlining monorepo development and reducing build times. Additionally, design systems like Tailwind UI and Radix UI are standardizing UI development, ensuring visual consistency across teams.

  //   ## WebAssembly (WASM) Gaining Ground
  //   WebAssembly is no longer just experimental — it's becoming mainstream for use cases like gaming, video editing, and running complex logic in the browser. Languages like Rust and Go are being compiled to WASM to power high-performance frontend modules.

  //   ## The Verdict
  //   2024 is a turning point for web development. As we move towards AI-augmented programming, edge-first infrastructure, and composable architectures, developers need to stay curious and adaptable. The stack you use today might look completely different in just 12 months — and that’s what makes this space so exciting.

      ## Background & Architecture

      | Framework | Language | Architecture | UI Approach |
      |----------|----------|--------------|--------------|
      | **Flutter** | Dart | Custom rendering engine | Fully custom UI |
      | **React Native** | JavaScript | JS bridge to native components | Native UI |
      | **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** | Kotlin | Shared business logic + native UI | Platform-native UI (Jetpack Compose/SwiftUI) |

      - **Flutter** uses its own rendering engine (Impeller) for full control over visuals across platforms.
      - **React Native** leverages a JavaScript bridge to communicate with native components.
      - **Kotlin Multiplatform** shares business logic and still allows native UI development, offering great performance and native experience.

      ---


      ## Performance & Benchmarks

      Here’s how each stacks up in real-world app performance (start time, FPS, memory usage):

      | Framework | Performance | Start Time | GPU Usage | Memory Footprint |
      |-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
      | **KMP** | Native performance | Fast | Optimized | Low |
      | **Flutter** | Very good | Slightly slower than native | Excellent | Medium |
      | **React Native** | Slower in complex apps | Delayed due to JS bridge | High in graphic use | Higher |

      - **Flutter** is best for UI-heavy apps, thanks to its efficient rendering engine.
      - **KMP** excels in performance due to native UI and compiled code.
      - **React Native** can suffer performance issues in animation-heavy or large-scale apps.

      ---

      ## Developer Experience & Ecosystem

      | Framework | Learning Curve | Tooling | Ecosystem |
      |-----------|----------------|---------|-----------|
      | **Flutter** | Medium (Dart) | Excellent (hot reload, dev tools) | Mature |
      | **React Native** | Easy (JS/TS) | Good | Huge JS ecosystem |
      | **KMP** | Medium (Kotlin) | Improving | Smaller but growing |

      - **Flutter** offers a unified development experience with a rich set of widgets and strong IDE support.
      - **React Native** benefits from JavaScript’s widespread use and ecosystem.
      - **KMP** is ideal for Kotlin/Android developers, especially when performance is critical and logic reuse is the main goal.

      ---

      ## Choosing the Right One

      | Use Case | Best Framework |
      |----------|----------------|
      | Need custom UI + fast dev | **Flutter** |
      | Have JS expertise or web team | **React Native** |
      | Require native UI + performance + shared logic | **Kotlin Multiplatform** |

      **Choose Flutter** if:
      - You want a consistent UI across platforms.
      - You care about performance and visual polish.

      **Choose React Native** if:
      - Your team is strong in JavaScript or TypeScript.
      - You want fast prototyping and lots of open-source libraries.

      **Choose Kotlin Multiplatform** if:
      - You want native performance and platform-specific UI.
      - You’re building complex Android-first apps and want to share logic with iOS.

      ---

      ## Conclusion

      There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Each framework has its strengths:

      - **Flutter** is a great choice for beautiful UIs and a unified codebase.
      - **React Native** works best for teams already comfortable with web development.
      - **Kotlin Multiplatform** excels in performance-critical apps where native UI is essential.

      Choosing the right framework depends on your **team’s skills**, **project complexity**, and **long-term goals**.
